## **Overview** 🌟

District News is a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform that delivers district-specific news, updates, and advertisements. Admins have exclusive access to manage content, ensuring a controlled and trustworthy information environment. The application includes robust authentication and authorization to protect content integrity.

## **Features** ✨

- **User Authentication & Authorization**
  - Secure JWT-based login and registration.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) differentiating users and admins.

- **Admin Panel**
  - Manage news, updates, and advertisements.
  - Exclusive admin control over content creation, editing, and deletion.

- **Responsive Design**
  - Mobile-first design ensuring seamless performance across devices.
  - Optimized for both dark and light themes.

- **Dynamic Content Management**
  - Real-time updates for news and advertisements.
  - Integrated rich text editor for content creation.

- **Security**
  - Encrypted passwords using bcrypt.
  - Secure API routes protected by JWT middleware.

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Lazy loading for images and resources.
  - Efficient database queries for minimal load times.

## **Tech Stack** 🛠️

- **Frontend**
  - **React.js**: For a dynamic and interactive UI.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For modern styling and responsive design.
  - **Axios**: For HTTP requests.

- **Backend**
  - **Node.js & Express**: For server-side logic and API routes.
  - **MongoDB & Mongoose**: For database management and object modeling.
  - **JWT**: For authentication and securing endpoints.

## **Architecture** 🏗️

The application follows the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) architecture:

1. **Client-Side**
   - React frontend interacts with the backend via RESTful APIs.
   - Modular and reusable UI components for scalability.

2. **Server-Side**
   - Express server handles API requests, processes data, and interacts with MongoDB.
   - Authentication middleware secures routes.

3. **Database**
   - MongoDB stores user information, news posts, advertisements, and admin credentials.
   - Mongoose models enforce data structure and integrity.

## **Prerequisites** 📋

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x.x or later)
- **MongoDB** (v4.x.x or later)
- **npm** (v6.x.x or later)
- **Cloudinary** (for cloud storage - optional)
- **Netlify & Vercel** (for deployment - optional)

## **Installation** 💻

Set up the project locally by following these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up MongoDB:**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or remotely.
   - Optionally, use Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo
     ```

5. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with these variables:

     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
     ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
     ```

6. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## **Usage** 🚀

### **Starting the Application**

1. **Frontend:**
   - Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Explore news and updates.

2. **Backend:**
   - The backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`.
   - All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

### **Accessing the Admin Panel**

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin`.
2. Enter admin credentials as set in the `.env` file.
3. Manage content on the platform.

### **Creating and Managing Content**

- **News/Updates**
  - Admins can post, edit, or delete articles with rich text formatting.
- **Advertisements**
  - Admins manage advertisements, including media uploads and targeting.

## **Admin Authentication** 🔒

### **Authentication Process**

- **Registration**
  - Users register with an email and password. Admins are created manually.
  
- **Login**
  - Secure login for users and admins with JWT token generation.

- **Authorization**
  - JWT tokens are verified for protected routes.
  - Admin routes include additional role checks.

### **Security Considerations**

- **Password Encryption**
  - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage.
  
- **Token Expiry**
  - JWT tokens have an expiry time for re-authentication.

## **Environment Variables** ⚙️

Essential environment variables:

- **`MONGO_URI`**: MongoDB connection string.
- **`JWT_SECRET`**: Secret key for JWT tokens.
- **`ADMIN_EMAIL`**: Default admin email.
- **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: Default admin password.

Example `.env` file:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/news_app
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
ADMIN_EMAIL=shivam
ADMIN_PASSWORD=11111
```
